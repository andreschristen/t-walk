The t-walk software
J. Andrés Christen and Colin Fox
CIMAT, Mexico and U. of Otago, New Zealand.


The t-walk is a "A self-adjusting multi-scale MCMC algorithm" 
that samples from arbitrary multidimensional
objective functions (posteriors).

See: http://www.cimat.mx/~jac/twalk/

This is the Python implementation, you would need the scipy and numpy
packeges installed and optionally matplotlib.pylab to do some histograms.

Install the module as any other python module:


% sudo python setup.py install

(is a pure Python module and therefore is platform independent). 


Go directly to pytwalktutorial.py for some examples, you may download it from
http://www.cimat.mx/~jac/twalk/pytwalktutorial.py .

The current version number may be found in the file VERSION.

Cheers,
J Andrés Christen.
