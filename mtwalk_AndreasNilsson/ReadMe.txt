The files in this directory perform posterior sampling (using the twalk) for 
a simple problem in curve fitting.

Synthetic data is generated by Mockdata.m, with the true curve (either linear or a sine bump)
measured at a set of points and corrupted with additive Gaussian noise.

The curve is then modelled using a radial basis function (RBF) representation, with a Gaussian
prior distribution over coefficients -- so a quadratic log-prior.

Run sampleRBF.m to get a demo.
